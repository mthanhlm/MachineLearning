## Introduction

This repository is a collection of machine learning projects I have completed as part of my coursework and self-study. The projects cover a range of topics, focusing on linear and logistic regression with different complexities and scenarios.

## Projects

### 1. Linear Regression with One Variable
- **Description:** Implementation of linear regression to predict outcomes based on a single feature.
- **Techniques:** Simple linear regression, cost function, gradient descent.
- **Files:** `Linear regression with one variable/`

### 2. Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
- **Description:** Implementation of linear regression to predict outcomes based on multiple features.
- **Techniques:** Multivariate linear regression, feature scaling, gradient descent.
- **Files:** `Linear regression with multiple variables/`

### 3. Linear Regression with Multiple Variables Multi-Level
- **Description:** Advanced implementation of linear regression considering multiple levels of variables.
- **Techniques:** Hierarchical linear models, feature interactions, regularization.
- **Files:** `Linear regression with multiple variables multi-level/`

### 4. Linear Logistic Regression
- **Description:** Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification problems.
- **Techniques:** Logistic function, cost function, gradient descent.
- **Files:** `Linear Logistic Regression/`

### 5. Non-linear Logistic Regression
- **Description:** Implementation of logistic regression with non-linear decision boundaries.
- **Techniques:** Polynomial features, kernel methods, regularization.
- **Files:** `Non-linear Logistic Regression/`

## Installation
